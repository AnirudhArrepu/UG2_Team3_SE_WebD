    <h3>Project Title</h3>
    <p>A website focusing on real-world marine experience and ocean pollution prevention/awareness through education. </p>
    <h4>SDG</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>14: Life below water</li>
      <li>4: Quality Education</li>
      <li>12: Responsible Consumption and Production</li>

    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <p>Our interactive website offers a unique educational experience that immerses users in marine ecosystems and sustainable fishing. By taking on the roles of fishermen, scientists, or students, players explore various aquatic environments, face real-world challenges like overfishing, and learn about marine biodiversity. Users gain a deep understanding of their decisions's impact on the ocean by engaging in real-life scenarios or stories randomly generated by AI, quizzes, and real-time weather updates. Additionally, our platform aims to contribute to marine research by streamlining the collection of marine data about fish catch, myths, unsolved scientific issues, etc. We invite users to upload valuable information, such as datasets or blog posts, which can be converted into usable info for researchers to study and advance in their research. We are also including a mini game where we simulate fishing.</p>
